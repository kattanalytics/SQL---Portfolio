# SQL & Data Portfolio – Kathryn Starkey  

Welcome! This portfolio highlights my skills in SQL, business intelligence, and data workflows.  
It is designed to demonstrate how I can query, transform, and visualize data to generate insights,  
as well as build a foundation for cloud-based data engineering.  

## 📌 About Me  
I am working toward a Data Support Analyst role, with a focus on:  
- SQL querying and optimization  
- Business intelligence dashboards (Power BI)  
- Cloud data warehouses and pipelines (Snowflake & Azure)  

This portfolio showcases real-world projects that demonstrate my problem-solving, attention to detail,  
and ability to work with data across different environments.
